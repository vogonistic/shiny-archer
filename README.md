# Shiny-Archer

An implementation of a mineflayer, a Minecraft bot api built in node.js.
Currently, Shiny-Archer has little to no purpose, but eventually, it might
become a useful bot. 

Currently Shiny-Archer only responds to commands through the REPL interface.

## Features

* Useful REPL-based command line interface for control and debugging.
* Somewhat working lumberjack functionality
* Useful utility functionality for mineflayer (entity.looksAt)

## Roadmap

* Farming
* Ladders
* Doors
* Patrol/Guarding
